  <p>Hey there! My name is Brian Turner, and I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer. I specialize in HTML/CSS, SASS, ES6 (JavaScript), Angular, React, Node.js, Express, SQL, and have been learning and creating projects in VueJS, and learning Angular 2 (4); I love learning new languages, as well as new aspects of languages I already know. Due to my love of learning new languages, I decided to pursue a Degree in Spanish -graduating with my Bachelor's from Utah Valley University in the Spring of 2014.</p>
  <p>My first job in the Development field was at SecurityMetrics in Orem, UT. I was chosen as the Internal Content Developer, and my main responsibility was to develop, program, and maintain a new internal wiki system for the entire company. There was an existing wiki which I was required to take down after going through to find all of the parts that were still useful. Basically I built the new wiki from the ground up, and then it was my job to maintain and update the wiki, ensuring it had the most up to date information for each department within the entire company. I built this wiki using mainly HTML/CSS, and an old language called "MoinMoin", which was specific to that exact wiki system.</p>
  <p>I ended up leaving that job, due to my financial needs as well as being offered a job which offered a better potential of meeting those needs. Over the next year, I spent the majority of my free-time online going through education programming sites like Code Academy and Kahn Academy, searching for and finding different tutorials that taught bits and pieces of multiple languages. In January of 2017, I began a 3 month immersive Web Development boot camp focusing exclusively on full-stack web development. The main languages covered were HTML/CSS, SASS, JavaScript (ES6), Angular, React, Node.js, Express, and SQL. We focused extensively on RESTful APIs, and how to access those APIs to make calls and retrieve or post data. The boot camp ended in the beginning of April,  I was offered two different internships, one of which I accepted and was set to begin at the start of the following month. Unfortunately, I had some personal and family issues come up causing me to let the company know that I would not be able to move forward with the Internship; an internship which I was very excited about starting. The internship was with the top company on my list of potential employers, but family is hands down the most important thing in my life, so I know that I had made the right choice. </p>
  <p>I'm currently in a position where I help train people to be successful selling on Amazong's platform, and then spending all of my free-time studying and learning new frameworks/libraries. I am looking for a postition as a Web Developer or UX/UI Designer in Utah County or SL County, as that is my real passion. I absolutely LOVE learning, and I'm eager to find a Web Dev/Design team to join where I can continue to challange and educate myself. I'm open to considering basically ANY type of position in this industry, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me regarding any opening you have within the field!
